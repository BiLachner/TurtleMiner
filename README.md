TurtleMiner is a highly work-in-progress Minetest mod. It is the first mod to ever attempt to create programmable robots from an educational perspective. Turtles can be accessed by rightclicking with a Turtle Remote Controller in hand. As of version 0.1, they can move and dig blocks. Soon they will have the ability to place blocks, and many other things. This mod is heavily inspired by [ComputerCraftEDU](https://computercraftedu.com). As more features are added, the [wiki](https://github.com/BiLachner/TurtleMiner/wiki) will be updated to further document the mod, and it's API.
